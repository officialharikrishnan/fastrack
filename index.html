        <h1>WATCHES THAT COMPLIMENT YOUR STYLE</h1>
        <p>Watches do not only help you keep track of time but also make a strong style statement. They add wings to
            your style and personality. Like a sultry dress or a pair of flawless shoes, wrist watches enhance your
            whole appearance. But before you go on making the purchase, you must decide what would be the best watch to
            suit your personality.</p>
        <h3>TYPES OF WATCHES AT FASTRACK</h3>
        <h5>ANALOGUE QUARTZ WATCHES</h5>
        <p>Analogue quartz wrist watches are battery-powered timepieces. They are the OGs of the watch world. If you
            want that classy, debonair look, analogue watches are the way to go. At Fastrack, we offer a wide range of
            analogue watches, available in different dial shapes, strap materials, and a host of colours.</p>
        <h5>DIGITAL WATCHES</h5>
        <p>Digital watches are the multi-featured, tech-savvy equivalents of their analogue counterparts. They are
            sporty, and always ready to go. These wrist watches are ideal for the active, outdoorsy watch wearers with
            features like altimeters, depth sensors, etc., that suit high-energy, on-the-go lives. Whether you want
            casual, dressy, or sporty, our watches have got you covered.</p>
        <h5>DIGITAL-ANALOGUE WATCHES</h5>
        <p>What if we tell you that you can get the classic look of an analogue watch combined with the features of a
            digital watch? Sounds like a perfect combination, doesn’t it? Our collection of digital-analogue watches is
            just that! With classic numerical dials and small digital screens, these watches come with a 5 ATM water
            resistance.</p>
        <h5>SMARTWATCHES</h5>
        <p>They are the new generation wrist watches. In addition to telling the time and keeping track of activities,
            these watches can be your trainer, your virtual assistant, and your mobile device, all wrapped up around
            your wrist. Our smartwatch collections come packed with features like 24x7 heart rate monitoring, blood
            oxygen and sleep tracking, stress monitoring, and 20+ sports modes. In addition to this, once paired with
            your smartphone, you can also receive notifications, react to texts, play music, and do so much more.</p>
        <h5>YOUR GUIDE TO PICKING THE PERFECT TIMEPIECE</h5>
        <p>We all have a unique sense of style that makes us stand out from the crowd. It is reflected in the kind of
            clothes we wear, the pair of shoes we pick, and the way we accessorise the entire outfit. All of this speaks
            volumes about who we are, so it is obvious that each piece of jewellery, clothing, and accessories we own is
            carefully picked out. So here we are, with some tips to help you decide what kind of watch would best fit
            your aesthetic.</p>
        <h5>1. ASK YOURSELF “WHY DO I WANT A WATCH?”</h5>
        <p>Yes, we know it sounds like a silly question, but it is an important one. Before you invest in a wrist watch,
            you must know what you are really going to use it for. If you only want a watch as a fine piece of
            accessory, we suggest that you get yourself a designer watch that doubles as an accessory. But if you are
            constantly active and need something to track your movements throughout the day, our recommendation would be
            a wrist watch from our digital or smartwatch collection. And for those who want a timepiece that is
            versatile, goes with every outfit, and is perfect for every occasion, we have our range of analogue and
            digital-analogue watches.</p>
        <h5>2. CONSIDER YOUR PERSONAL STYLE</h5>
        <p>Once you know why is it that you want to own one of your timepieces, the next step would be to visit us
            in-store or on our website to browse through our collection of wrist watches. We will help you find
            something that best suits your personal style.</p>
        <h3>FAQS</h3>
        <h5>1. HOW DO I CHOOSE A WATCH FOR MYSELF?</h5>
        <p>First, you need to decide what kind of watch you want. You can choose analogue, digital, or a smartwatch.
            Next, you must figure out what is your budget, based on that, you can find options that best suit your style
            and needs.</p>
        <h5>2. WHAT IS THE MOST SUITABLE STYLE OF WATCHES FOR GIRLS?</h5>
        <p>Our catalogue includes analogue watches, smartwatches, and digital watches for girls in multiple designs,
            colours, and strap materials.</p>
        <h5>3. HOW MUCH DO YOUR WATCHES COST?
        </h5>
        <p>We offer a variety of analogue, digital, and smartwatches in the price range of 500 INR to 5000 INR.</p>
        <h5>4. IS IT BETTER TO BUY ANALOGUE OR DIGITAL?</h5>
        <p>Both formats are great choices and choosing between one of the two can be a personal preference. Analogue watches are more towards the simple, classic watch designs, whereas digital watches are a little more complicated than analogues.</p>
